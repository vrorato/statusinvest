# statusinvest
This code makes a webscraping of a stock site in Brazil called Status Invest.

You can select which stocks you want to analyze by adding on the list at the beginning of the code.

Once the list is done, the code will go to the website and create a dataframe with valuation indicators of all the stocks you want to check.

After that, it creates an excel sheet with stock divided by sheet_name of the stock. 

Data gathered here will show the indicator since 2018, like DY, P/L, PEG Ratio, P/VP, EV/EBITDA and other if it is available at the website.

This is a faster way to see how a company is compared to its peers on the Brazilian Stock Exchange - B3.

It's important to say that the website has a free part for all the stocks, but the information must always be double-checked, this is just a interesting way of using python on financial market to enhance your analysis.
